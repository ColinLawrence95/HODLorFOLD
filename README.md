## Description
HOLD or FOLD is a full-stack web application that allows users to track cryptocurrency prices and place bets on whether a coin's price will go up or down within a given time period. Users can compete against each other using a fake currency called tokens. The app provides real-time market data and a thrilling betting experience for crypto enthusiasts.

This project was built to combine cryptocurrency price tracking with a competitive, gamified betting system. The goal is to create an engaging and educational platform where users can test their market predictions in a risk-free environment.
